## Intro

Its been awhile since I played around with another language besides Typescript. Everything I have done professionally in the last 5 years has been Typescript and its my go-to language for any silly side projects I do. Some of those side projects are in different languages but I've never treated them as serious projects to learn something new with. 

The main issue with the majority of my side projects (and I'm sure you agree) is that there's no _motivation_ to continue working on them once the honeymoon phase is over. Once I'm done checking out new tech, I usually just forget about the project. I'm not sure why: perhaps its because I have no real use for the project. Or maybe I just didn't like it. Whatever the reasons are for dropping side projects, its always saddens me to get excited about something new and then do _nothing_ with it. 

So I'm going to try something new. I'm going to learn a new language, and write blogs about my journey. This should motivate me... right?

But what language should I learn? I've always leaned towards backend development so why not find a language thats popular for backend? It just so happens a friend told me about Ruby not too long ago and that I should give it a try. Why not? Ruby is popular for backend development, and comparable to Javascript which should make an easy transition. 

So I've decided to learn Ruby!

Now that I selected a language to learn, I need a project to work on. Nothing springs to mind, so I've decided to just use this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). If you don't know what Advent of Code is, its like an advent calendar... except with code challenges every day. Exactly what it sounds like!

Now I got a new language, and a project. All I need to do is get started!

## Getting Started

Uhh... _how_ do I get started?

Starting projects are always the hardest part in my opinion. Theres always so much to do, especially if you are starting out with a completely new tech stack. So I started at step 0: installing Ruby.
