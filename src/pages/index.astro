        Welcome to my little slice of the internet where I talk about my
        projects, give my opinions on things in the tech world, and just
        generally rant about things. Expect opinionated views from me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will this be the best site to learn new tech things and get super handy
        developer tips?
      </p>
      <p>Probably not.</p>
      <p>
        But will this site have good entertaining content that the whole family
        looks forward to?
      </p>
      <p>Again probably not.</p>
      <p>
        Saying that I do hope that some of my developer experiences can help you
        or you perhaps get a good chuckle from my rantings every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh and just in case you couldn't tell yet, this site is 99% the
        blog-template from
        <a href='https://astro.build/'>Astro</a> ðŸš€ (an awesome static content framework
        that this site is built from)! I'm slowly working on this site to give it
        my own vibe, and I'm using the generated content to learn how to use Astro.
        So if you see anything that looks generated, then I just haven't got around
        to update it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        So to wrap it up: welcome to my site, expect opinionated views, forgive
        the rough edges, and enjoy what you read!
